  "review_01_trk": "We are located far away, in a hard to reach neighborhood. Getting hold of a forklift was always a problem.  Estamos lejos y en una zona dif√≠cil de llegar; conseguir un clark siempre es un problema. But ClarkATiempo really surprised us, they brought the forklift on a flatbed. Amazing.",
  "review_02_trk": "The female employee on the phone was very kind, and the forklift was at my warehouse's door at the agreed time. Everything OK.",
  "review_03_trk": "They charged me only for the time I used the vehicle. Finally, someone honest!!!!!",
  "review_04_trk": "The girl came personally and took care of everything, I dindn't even had to speak to the driver. Excellent service, I recommend it.",
  "review_05_trk": "I work with heavy press moulds, which I have to move around several times a week. As my workshop is too small, I can't even park a straddle stacker inside, so I used to spend a fortune on forklift guys and rentals, who also took their sweet time to come. All of that is in the past now that I found Clarkatiempo. They really saved me a world of trouble. Thanks!!!",
  "review_06_trk": "At last somebody who doesn't charge an outrageous hourly rate!",
  "review_07_trk": "I owed a forklift for a while, and it was an endless source of pain. The only reason why I kept it, was because the hourly rate when hiring outside was so expensive! Now I work with Clarkatiempo, and I never looked back."
